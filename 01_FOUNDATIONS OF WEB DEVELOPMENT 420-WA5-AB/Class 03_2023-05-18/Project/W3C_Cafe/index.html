        <p>19 May 2023</p>
        <article>
            <p>Working and studying from home can be really hard on your body and mind, so it is important to try and move around a bit each day. Walking around your work space while on the phone or standing while eating a snack are easy ways to become a little less sedentary. As well, stretching a little bit each day can help you avoid things like "tech neck" and back pain. Here are some easy stretches you can do from your desk!</p>
        </article>
        
        <h2 id="one">1. Tricep stretch</h2>
        <p>Stand and hold onto a wall or the back of a chair for balance if needed.
    Grab the top of the left foot and bend your knee, bringing the foot towards the glutes, knee pointing straight at the floor. You should feel a stretch down the front of your leg.
    Squeeze your hips forward for a deeper stretch.
    Hold for 15 to 30 seconds and switch sides, repeating one to three times per leg.</p>
        <h2 style="border:2px solid Tomato;" id="two">2. Standing Hamstring Stretch</h2>
        <p style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">Take your left foot forward and tip from the hips, keeping the back flat.
    Lower down until you feel a stretch in the back of the leg.
    Rest the hands on the upper thighs to give your back some support. 
    Hold for 15 to 30 seconds and switch sides, repeating one to three times.
    If you feel shaky or your hamstrings are tight, try using a resistance band to give you more leverage.</p>
        <h2 id="three">3. Chest and Shoulder Stretch</h2>
        <p>Sit or stand and clasp your hands together behind your back, arms straight.
    Lift your hands towards the ceiling, going only as high as is comfortable. You should feel a stretch in your shoulders and chest.
    Hold for 15 to 30 seconds, repeating one to three times.
    If your shoulders are a little tight, try just taking your arms behind you and out to the sides like an airplane.</p>
